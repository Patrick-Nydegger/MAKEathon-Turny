For detecting people in the turnover process (workers and passengers), a model has been trained using Custom Vision on Microsoft Azure. This model can detect the behavior of process participants, thereby identifying the situation and potential disruptions in operations. Based on this information, action recommendations are proposed within a GUI and triggered upon confirmation.
